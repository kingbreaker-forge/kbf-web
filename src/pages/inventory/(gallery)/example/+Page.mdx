Serial X-000 was a testbed for a compact kitchen petty that still feels substantial in hand. I forged a tight ladder pattern in 1084/15N20, kept the spine at 3.2 mm near the bolster, and chased the balance point right at the front of the maple handle so it pivots easily for tip work.

The stabilized burl, carbon fiber spacer, and bronze bolster were picked to echo the ripple in the blade without going loud, and everything rides at ~61 HRC after a Parks 50 quench. This one lives in the shop as a reference build for future small-batch kitchen knives.
