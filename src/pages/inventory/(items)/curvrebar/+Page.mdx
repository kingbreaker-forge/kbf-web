This was a simple and quick experiment in knife shaping. It is the first fully-curved S-shaped knife I have made. Since the objective was not to create a high performance "production" knife, and to facilitate working quickly by using a softer metal, I used half-inch rebar as the material. As such, **this is not a proper hardened knife**.

That's not to say it's not hardened or sharp. I have had decent luck hardening rebar by using a hot quench in water. It gains some decent springiness, and can be sharpened a respectable amount. However, it dulls easily, and I cannot vouch for other factors of its performance. It is also likely to become a matte gray as it ages.

It was a cool experiment though, and it looks pretty cool.
