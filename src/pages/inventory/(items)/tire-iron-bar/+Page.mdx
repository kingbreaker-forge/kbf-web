This knife was made out of peculiar material: an old, rusty tire iron I found in my yard. No, really. I had lost something else and was looking for it with a metal detector. Instead of finding what I wanted, I found this. I had never seen it before. Who knows how long it was in the yard?

I started working it on Halloween, along with the [Halloween Demo Knife](/inventory/halloween-demo) (and using the same source metal).

Unlike that one though, I ran into some difficulties with this one. Specifically, some folds/cracks that are present in the bottle opener segment of the handle. The knife has been put on "backburner" until I can get back to it and figure out how to fix those (likely grind them off and reprofile the bottle opener).
