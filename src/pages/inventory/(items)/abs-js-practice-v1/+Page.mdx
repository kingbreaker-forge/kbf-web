Though I am not a member of the [American Bladesmith Society (ABS)](https://www.americanbladesmith.org/) yet, what better way to practice making a high performance blade than to make one intended to stand up to their [Journeyman Smith test](https://www.americanbladesmith.org/testing-journeyman-bladesmith/)? No frills, no joking about, just good steel and a good edge.

Some of the specs listed for the knife are speculative/aspirational until I make more progress with it. The intent is to develop a knife that passes as many of the criteria as possible that a blade would need in order to pass the ABS JS test. To save you from clicking, here's a summary of [what standards I need to meet](<(https://www.americanbladesmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JS-Testing-2-17-2025.pdf)>):

### Blade Parameters/Construction

The blade is made of forged, homogeneous (no Damascus), high carbon spring steel. It must have a maximum blade length of 10 inches (25.4 cm), maximum overall length of 15 inches (38.1 cm), and maximum blade width of 2 inches (5.08 cm). Any handle configuration is OK. No special finish is required. The only ask is that it is "safe to use".

### The Testing

The test consists of four steps, done in order.

1. Using a single motion, cut through a free-hanging 1-inch diameter rope (manila or sisal). The ABS test allows 3 attempts, but I will take more if I need to (since I will be working to refine the edge of my knife if it doesn't work).

2. Chop completely through a 2x4 construction grade pine stud, twice.

3. Using the part of the blade most heavily used in the chopping, demonstrate that the knife's edge is still sharp enough to reasonably dry-shave some hair off my arm or leg.

4. Clamp the knife in a vise, then bend it 90&deg; to one side, then to the other. It should survive without breaking. Up to 1/3 of the edge chipping/cracking, and taking a permanent bend are fine and expected. This is a destructive test.

### My Expectation

I will probably handle parts 1 and 2 fine. Part 3 is a big question, since I have never stress-tested my fine edges to that degree. Part 4 will _probably_ be fine, since I make my blades fairly thin and quite flexible.

I'll finish the knife, take a video of the test, and keep you posted! 🤞
