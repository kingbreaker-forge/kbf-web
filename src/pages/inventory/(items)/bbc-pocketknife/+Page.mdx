"BBC" stands for "Ball Bearing Canister", of course.

This is my fanciest accomplishment so far: a damascus knife I forged myself! With something like this, it's all about the process, so if you're curious, check out [the blog post about it](/blog/bbc-pocketknife).

The knife is small and handy, perfect for everyday carry. The ball bearing pattern really pops, and the blade is very sharp and holds an edge well.

It is my everyday carry knife now, and I love it.
