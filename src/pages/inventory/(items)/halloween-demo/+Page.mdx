A Halloween tradition at my house is to move the forge and annvil to the front yard. It spreads awareness of blacksmithing as a modern fun hobby, and provides fascination for kids and adults alike. This piece was the outcome of Halloween 2025, along with the [Tire Iron Bar Knife](/inventory/tire-iron-bar).

This knife was made out of peculiar material: an old, rusty tire iron I found in my yard. No, really. I had lost something else and was looking for it with a metal detector. Instead of finding what I wanted, I found this. I had never seen it before. Who knows how long it was in the yard?

The material passed a spark test, so I assumed it was medium/high carbon tool steel, and treated it accordingly. It was worked by hand to shape. I quenched it in canola oil, and tempered it fairly aggressively. The only grinder work was shaping the tip and creating the initial bevel.

The knife was sharpened to shave-sharp, and has made itself useful as a box cutter and general decorative piece.
